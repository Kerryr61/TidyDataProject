 This file describes the transformed data resulting from the run_analysis.R script.  The script selects just the variables for mean,
 Mean, and std from the training and test UCI HAR dataset.  The script also adds the activityID, activity, and subjectID 
 variables from activity_labels, y_train, y_test, subject_train, and subject_test files.  The script also modifies the original
 variable names to be more descriptive.
 The following changes were made to the feature names from the original
  "tBodyAcc" -> "timeBodyAcceleration"
  "Mag" -> "Magnitude"
  "fBodyAcc" -> "frequencyBodyAcceleration"
  "fBodyGyro" -> "frequencyBodyGyro"
  "tBodyGyro" -> "timeBodyGyro"
  "tGravityAcc" -> "timeGravityAcceleration"
  "fBodyBodyAcc" -> "frequencyBodyBodyAcceleration"
  "fBodyBodyGyro" -> "frequencyBodyBodyGyro"

For a full description of the features see features_info in the working directory of the unzipped data.
